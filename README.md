## Usage

Manage your Cozy by their domain name.

```bash
cozy-deploy deploy my.cozy.example.com
```

Once deployed, if you have **properly set your DNS**, this Cozy will be accessible at https://my.cozy.example.com    
It may take a while for your Cozy to fully initialize.

From there, you can display logs, update, monitor or open a shell on this Cozy. Here is the full set of commands:
```
Usage: cozy-deploy COMMAND [domain]

Options:
    help                          Print the list of commands
    init                          Initialize Nginx proxy configuration in /etc/nginx/conf.d/cozy-deploy.conf
    init-pagekite                 Initialize PageKite configuration in /root/.pagekite.rc
    restart-pagekite              Restart PageKite daemon
    pull                          Fetch the latest cozy/full official image from Docker Hub
    build                         Build a cozy/full image manually from the GitHub repository https://github.com/cozy-labs/cozy-docker
    update-image                  Update cozy-deploy and the base image

    list                          List deployed Cozies
    list-domains                  Only list domain names associated with actual Cozies
    start-all                     Start all previously stopped Cozies
    update-all                    Launch application updates on all the Cozies
    upgrade-all                   Launch a system upgrade on all the Cozies
    monitor                       Monitor resources used by the Cozies or by a specific Cozy

    deploy     <domain>           Deploy a new Cozy container
    deploy-dev <domain>           Deploy a new Cozy container with NODE_ENV=development and all the port forwarded to the host
    remove     <domain>           Remove a Cozy, its data and its configuration
    enter      <domain>           Open a shell in the specified Cozy
    status     <domain>           Show the status of the Cozy's services
    logs       <domain>           Display the last lines of interesting log files in the specified Cozy
    update     <domain>           Launch application updates on a Cozy
    upgrade    <domain>           Launch a system upgrade on a Cozy
```


## PageKite

Cozy Deploy provides a [PageKite](https://pagekite.net) seemless integration.    
Subscribe to a PageKite account, [get your Kite Secret](https://pagekite.net/home/#show_account_details), and save your settings on your host by running:

```bash
cozy-deploy init-pagekite
```

Then you will be able to deploy containers accessible to the Internet without having to deal with DNS or port opening.    

Just indicate a new PageKite domain (like `xxx-myaccount.pagekite.me`) and follow the instructions:

```bash
cozy-deploy deploy xxx-myaccount.pagekite.me
```

**Note**: Using `xxx-myaccount.pagekite.me` will deploy an HTTPS-ready container, and `xxx.myaccount.pagekite.me` will deploy an HTTP one.


## SSL certificates

SSL Certificates are located in `/etc/cozy-deploy/ssl/`.    

By default all the certificates are self-signed, except on PageKite domains. Just change one of them and restart Nginx if you want to use your own certificate.


## Bash/ZSH completion

The `bash_completion` file is automatically copied in `/etc/bash_completion.d/`. Nothing further to do on Bash.

If you are on ZSH and you want to enjoy `cozy-deploy` command completion, add this to you `.zshrc`:
```
autoload bashcompinit
bashcompinit
source /etc/bash_completion.d/cozy-deploy
```


## Upgrading

```bash
cozy-deploy update-image
```

It will update the `cozy-deploy` executable and pull the latest version of the Docker image.


## Development mode

If you want to simulate a Cozy installation directly on your host, by forwarding all the interesting automaticaly, run:

```bash
cozy-deploy deploy-dev my.dev.cozy
```

You are now able to access your proxy directly: http://localhost:9104 and run your applications seemlessly on your host.


## Hack

Just edit `/usr/local/bin/cozy-deploy` and you are good to go!


## Security

Cozies are running on high ports (>`49000`). Make sure that you close them and let only `80` and `443` open.


## TODO

* Backup/restore
* Snapshot (via docker commit and tags)
